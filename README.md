# Git commands cheatsheet: the most useful git commands

## 1. Navigate to your git project folder


Use `cd` to move between folders. E.g:


```
cd workspace
cd bdl02_sachs_git_cheatsheet
```

## 2. Check the status of the project

I can use this any time

- `git status` 

I can see if some changes happened and if some files are ready to be committed. It gives me an overview of the project at that specific moment in line.


- `git log`
- `git diff`
